# Birthday-Paradox
A Python-based simulation and probability calculator for the Birthday Paradox â€” exploring how likely it is that two people in a group share the same birthday. Includes visualizations, code for multiple group sizes, and comparison with theoretical probability.

 The Birthday Paradox shows us that in a group of N people, the odds
 that two of them have matching birthdays is surprisingly large.
 This program does a Monte Carlo simulation (that is, repeated random
 simulations) to explore this concept.

 (It's not actually a paradox, it's just a surprising result.)
